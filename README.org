#+TITLE: pd-gui: a collection of PureData GUI elements, made in PureData

This is a collection (for now, only a knob) of PureData GUI elements
implemented purely in PureData. Unfortunately, the PureData data
structures are quite limited, but if you try hard enough you can hack
your way through it and do a lot of things. Of course, you could do
everything, but performance is a big problem.

* Knob
A customizable knob element, purely using data structures. The look is
inspired by Mutable Instruments. Double-click to put the knob dial to
the middle (i.e. reset it).
** Showcase
[[./knob.gif][An animated image presenting the knob]]
** TODOs
+ fix the "set: empty pointer" bug (it doesn't impact usage at all,
  just an error)
+ adapt [drawnumber] scalars so they fit most sizes better
+ labels in the middle of the knob
+ display of the current value on click (was implemented, scrapped it
  for now)
+ number ranges (???)
+ remove "expr" objects to make it more cool
