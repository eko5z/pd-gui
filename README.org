#+TITLE: pd-gui: a collection of PureData GUI elements, made in PureData

This is a collection (for now, only a knob) of PureData GUI elements
implemented purely in PureData. Unfortunately, the PureData data
structures are quite limited, but if you try hard enough you can hack
your way through it and do a lot of things. Of course, you could do
everything, but performance is a big problem.

* Knob
A customizable knob element, purely using data
structures. Double-click to put the knob dial to the customizable
default value. Click (or turn) to show the value.
